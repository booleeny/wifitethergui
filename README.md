Share your wired Ethernet connection as WiFi Hotspot using Win 8, 8.1, 10. 
With GUI

It's my first python project and first GUI.

It is using netsh commands to add an wifi adapter and share your wired LAN connection via WiFi. 

                          LAN -> Notebook -> WiFi -> Handy/Mobilephone
